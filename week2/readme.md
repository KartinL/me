TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In exercise 2, we learnt that the argument inside the brackets have to be the same. The def = define, getLetter is the name and (index) is the argument. 

If we are returning a string, then we use ascii_lowercase
but if we are returning alphahet then we use lower()

Square bracket: for indexing 
Round bracket: for arguments and tuples

You can leave the argument blank

Map: iterable object, can go through it but can't index it 

List: is a list of things

Can index a list 

For exercise 3,

modulo division using the '%' operator 

13%5 = 3 because 5 goes into 13 twice and 3 is left over 

Remember to tab to index the code properly. 

Control structures

u indent things
in if, else, elif statements
u indent things in functions
u indent things in for and while loops

A function
Is when u give something an input
And it will return an output
Its like a toaster
Ur input is bread
The toaster is the function
And it will output toast
in this case the inputs is number_of_times and the symbol
Ur writing the function

If u put quotation marks
It becomes a string
But u want it to be a variable
But u want to reference the variable
U dont want the word symbol repeated 5 times
Which is what ur doing rn

If u put it in quotation marks ur printing out the word symbol
But if u dont
Then ur printing out what symbol they gave u
Like # In this case

Read from outside to inside

for two loops, you do the number of rows and then columns
